# Welcome to my amazing notes app!

## Project Description
My app is designed to make taking and managing notes a breeze. With my app, you can add, list, update, delete, save, load, and search for notes with just a few clicks.

## How the app works:

#### Adding a note:

To add a note, enter the "Add Note" number.  This will open up a new field of options where you can type in your note.

#### Listing notes:

To list all the notes you have saved in the app, enter  the "List Notes" number. This will show you a list of all the notes you've saved so far. The same action is required for seeing the notes that are active, archived, private ,or public.

#### Deleting a note:

To delete a note, simply enter the "Delete Note" number and then enter the index you want to delete from the list.

#### Updating a note:

If you need to update a note, you can do so by entering the "Update Note" number. This will allow you to edit the note you want to update.

#### Saving notes:

To save your notes, enter the "Save Notes" number. This will store all your notes in a json file in the app, making them easily accessible for future use.

#### Loading saved notes:

If you need to access saved notes, enter the "Load Notes" number. This will bring up all the notes you have previously saved.

#### Searching for notes:

If you need to find a specific note, you can use our search function. Simply either enter the "Search Title" or "Search Owner" number and type in the keyword you want to look for.

That's it! My notes app is simple, intuitive, and reliable. We hope you enjoy using it as much as we enjoyed creating it. Happy note-taking!
